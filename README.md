This is a simulation of the board game Onitama: https://www.arcanewonders.com/game/onitama/
I had a great time developing this, and I hope you get a kick out of it. 
You can play by cloning the repo, pip installing and running Start.py.

Each AI is different. Tanya and Larry use the minimax algorithm to determine their moves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax

Currently you can only watch robots battle each other (robot vs robot) so don't tick the 'human' boxes. Choose the robots to vs each other from the drop down.
Check out their code and see if you can figure out how they will behave, and which ones will win.
Click to go to next move.
