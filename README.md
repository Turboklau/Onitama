This is a simulation of the board game Onitama: ttps://www.arcanewonders.com/game/onitama/
I had a great time developing this, and I hope you get a kick out of it. You can play by running Start.py.

Each AI is different. Tanya uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

Currently you can only watch robots battle each other (robot vs robot). Click to go to next move.
